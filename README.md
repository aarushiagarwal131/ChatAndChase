# ChatAndChase


 Files client1.java and server1.java is for a simple chat interface. It imports various packages including Swing and AWT for the user interface, and IO for 
networking functionality.
The program creates a JFrame object and adds various components to it, such as buttons, text fields, and labels, to create a chat interface. When the "PLAY" button is clicked, 
it calls a method named "caller()" from another class named "Test." When the "Send" button is clicked, it sends the text in the text field to the output stream and displays 
it in the chat interface. The text is formatted using HTML and added to a JPanel using a BoxLayout.
